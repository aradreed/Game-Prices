# Game-Prices v0.5.1
## Description
Grabs the recent price from pricecharting.com for video games. Pass it a game name, and it will display the loose price, complete price, and new price for the game. Currently only works for specific games (ones that are redirected to their own page instead of the search).

## Usage
```
./gamePrices super mario bros
